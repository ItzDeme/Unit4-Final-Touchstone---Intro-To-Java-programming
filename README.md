# Unit4-Final-Touchstone---Intro-To-Java-programming
This repo is based on Sophia.org Intro to java Programming course. It's the final touchstone that showcases what I learned.

I want to solve a real world problem. I want to create a login/signup form. That verifies login attempts and sign up attempts. I want the program to also LOG each attempt to a file and determine if it was successful or not successful, and state what happened. Additionally I want the program to also be able to read/list out all the logging from the file. This is something that was asked of me in an interview recently. I wasnâ€™t able to do it.This is the perfect time to redeem myself.

The program will need user/name and password when signing up or logging in. It would also need date and time input for pulling the logs.

This program will create its own data, with user input.
